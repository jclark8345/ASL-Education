## Project Introduction

The initial goal of the project was to establish an interaction between the user, the Leap Motion controller and the javascript program ultimately building a system that teachs a user the first 10 ASL digits. The system challenged the user to sign an ASL digit; detect whether they are; tell the user whether they are succeeding or not; and determine, after several seconds, whether they have succeeded or failed. Digit detection occurred through the use of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm trained on cleaned/normalized data from all students in the class.
